# Perrubot

*@Perrubot* is a twitter bot made with a free-context grammar in Tracery. 

This bot imitates the personality of a pair of dogs, Bruno and Rocco, as if they were posting on Twitter about their daily life 🐶🐕

The FCG.jason file is the grammar used to generate the tweets to be published once a day in the account.

To write and tweet we used https://cheapbotsdonequick.com/
